My primary stack is React, Apollo, GraphQL, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL, but I love learning learning new stuff and lately I have been teaching myself python/Flask in order to explore some of python's rich libraries for data analysis. I love how building websites combines logical problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration."
